      <li>His nickname… is “Matz” (or… “The Matz”)?</li><br>

      <li>There is even a saying about how nice “The Matz” is, as a long abbreviation: <br>
      His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as <strong>MINASWAN</strong>.</li><br>

     <li>“The Matz” even has a self-named ruby interpretation “MRI” (Matz’s Ruby Interpreter). </li><br>

     <li> AND a less cool named “MRuby” (Where the "M" is obviously… The MATZ).</li><br>
     <li>The Matz is the chief architect of Ruby at Heroku.</li><br>
     <li>He is married with 4 children</li><br>

    <h2> Insteresting quotes: </h2>
      <blockquote> "Instead of emphasizing the what, I want to emphasize the how part: how we feel while programming. That's Ruby's main difference from other language designs. I emphasize the feeling, in particular, how I feel using Ruby. I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python."</blockquote>

      <blockquote> "Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose. People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do. Maybe Python code is a bit more readable. Everyone can write the same style of Python code, so it can be easier to read, maybe. But the difference from one person to the next is so big, providing only one way is little help even if you're using Python, I think. I'd rather provide many ways if it's possible, but encourage or guide users to choose a better way if it's possible.</blockquote>

      <blockquote> "Because computers don't mind if I must make effort to communicate with them or if it is easy to communicate with them. They don't care if I put the numbers of instruction byte sequences in a file and feed it to them to run, or if a very high level language generated the instructions. The computers don't care. We humans care about the effort we pay. Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."</blockquote>
